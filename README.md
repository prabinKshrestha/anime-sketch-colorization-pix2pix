# Anime Sketch Colorization using GAN-based Techniques

### Abstract

Anime sketch colorization, a subset of image-to-image translation in computer vision, has witnessed notable
advancements, particularly through the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This paper explores the efficacy of
Pix2Pix, a conditional GAN framework, in automating and enhancing the process of anime sketch colorization. We present a
comprehensive review of related works in this domain, highlighting the evolution from heuristic-based methods to deep learning
techniques like GANs. Specifically, we delve into the architecture and methodology of Pix2Pix, detailing its generator and discriminator
designs, loss functions, and experimental setups. Our experiments utilize a dataset of paired anime sketch and color images,
employing evaluation metrics such as Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Fr ÃÅechet Inception Distance (FID), and Peak Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (PSNR) to assess model performance. Results demonstrate progressive improvements in image quality and realism over training
epochs, with notable enhancements observed in FID and PSNR scores. Despite challenges such as training instability and fluctuating
SSIM scores, our experiments underscore the potential of Pix2Pix in automating anime sketch colorization tasks, paving the way for further
research and advancements in this domain.
